# Experimental Design project
The project explored the factors associated with blood PSA levels in prostate cancer using techniques from statistical design of experiments.

Data set was taken from the textbook "Applied Linear Statistical Models" by Kutner et al. The description of the dataset is available under Appendix C.5 of the book. Data is freely available at this link - [Prostate cancer dataset](https://users.stat.ufl.edu/~rrandles/sta4210/Rclassnotes/data/textdatasets/KutnerData/Appendix%20C%20Data%20Sets/APPENC05.txt).

In this project the following were performed:
* Demonstrated correlation between the grade of cancer and antigen levels in blood using fixed effects ANCOVA model.
* Performed explanatory modeling to identify factors with statistically significant effects on the log concentration of a specific antigen.
* Performed hypothesis tests and model adequacy checking to justify model appropriateness.
