The project explored the factors associated with blood PSA levels in prostate cancer using techniques from statistical design of experiments.

Data set was taken from the textbook "Applied Linear Statistical Models" by Kutner et al. The description of the dataset is available under Appendix C.5 of the book. Data is freely available at this link - [Prostate cancer dataset](https://users.stat.ufl.edu/~rrandles/sta4210/Rclassnotes/data/textdatasets/KutnerData/Appendix%20C%20Data%20Sets/APPENC05.txt).
